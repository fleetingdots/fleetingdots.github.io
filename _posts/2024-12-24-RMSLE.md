title: When to Use Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)?
---

RMSE is the RMSE  of log transformed predicted and target values. This measurement is useful when:

- There is a wide range in the target variable, and you do not necessarily want to penalize large errors when the predicted and target values are themselves high.
- You care about percentage errors rather than the absolute value of errors.
- Using RMSLE may imply the dataset contains outliers
